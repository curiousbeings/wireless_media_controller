This is a simple example on how a client and server react using REST calls. Here only GET call is explained.
The web client makes call to FLASK server and displays the response

Request made by the web client: GET "http://127.0.0.1:5000/run/<number>" where number is the number entered in the input field
The response is the square of the number.
